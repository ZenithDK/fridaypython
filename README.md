# Friday Python scripts

This repository contains some scripts I have made to make my life at work a little bit easier.

Since this is a public repository and I'm not sure my employer wants me to share too many details, the documentation isn't very good. My coworkers who might benefit from those scripts will have received the appropriate information in an e-mail.
